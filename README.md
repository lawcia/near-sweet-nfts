# NEAR Sweet NFTs

Challenge 2: NEAR NFT Smart Contract

This website is a gallery for the Sweet NFTs on NEAR.

Hosted on Netlify: https://sweet-nfts-testnet-near.netlify.app/

Users can login using their NEAR Wallet, then they will be directed to see a list of NFTs.

They can select an NFT to Mint.

Minted NFTs will then become disabled, preventing the user from minting.

After navigating to https://wallet.testnet.near.org/?tab=collectibles, the user should then see their newly minted NFT in their collection.

This contract has been deployed on the testnet
